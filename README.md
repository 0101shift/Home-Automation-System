# Home-Automation-System
The project aims in setting up a sensor network interface where the user can sense, track and control their devices with a simple GUI. The sensor network consists of a small sensing &amp; control unit called as slave node which is connected to a Master through RS485 bus. Each master is capable of controlling up to 16 slave nodes and all the Masters are connected to cloud for wireless data access.
